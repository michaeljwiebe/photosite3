## Summary
Personal photography site redesign using bootstrap and jQuery

## Components
### `srcset` and `sizes`
For optimized image loading I have used the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes of the `<img>` tags to let the browser determine the appropriate image to download. Because the HTML file loads very quickly, putting this information in it allows the browser to quickly send out image requests and load the page faster. This also helps to keep total page data low for mobile devices or slow connections.

### JavaScript
I incorporated a mini nav bar for phones and the sliding feature triggered by the 'next' and 'back' buttons to make the site have a nice feel.
